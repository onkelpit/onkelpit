- 👋 Hi, I’m @onkelpit
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, security, hardware hacking, reverse engineering, brewing beer, growing food and other stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning yocto/OE, devops stuff, digging deeper in the kernel, bootloaders and so on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source stuff.
